              --- How to make your own grids with text files ---

Make a new text file, then use 0s to represent dead cells and 1s to represent
living ones. 

1s are only used to represent living cells by convention, but in reality, any 
character that is not a 0 will be interpreted as a living cell, unless it is 
leading or trailing whitespace. 

In the event that a line contains leading whitespace, it will be interpreted as 
though it started at the first non-whitespace character on the line, meaning all 
the cells will be shifted over to the left.

On the other hand, if a line contains trailing whitespace, it will be padded
with dead cells to fill in the dimensions of the grid.

Grids can only be rectangular, but any irregularity in line length is handled by
the program automatically.

Here are some examples to get you started:

00000
00100
00100 - This will make a line that turns 90 degrees every generation.
00100
00000

00000
01110
00010 - This will make a "glider" that moves up and to the right forever.
00100
00000

0000
0110 - This will make a square that stays the same forever.
0110
0000

It's important to note that this version of Conway's Game of Life loops around
onto itself. One could think of the actual simulation being like a globe, while
the view we see is just a 2D projection onto our screen, much like a world map.

P.S. For fun, you could even try opening this file as a grid in the program!
